# Password_Checker v1

## Reason for Creation
In modern times, we cannot separate software from our daily lives. While it brings many benefits, it can also pose significant threats to us. Among these, security is an aspect we need to consider deeply.  
I have created a website that checks users' passwords.  
This site evaluates the user's password based on predetermined scoring criteria and categorizes the password into one of five risk levels.

## Development Tools
- FastAPI

## How It Works
The site accepts a password from the user and sends it to the `Check_password` file to score the password.  
The calculated score is then used to determine the user's risk level.
